# Unity Based VR Head Gesture Recognition
Basic Unity application to recognise when simple Head based gestures (Nodding/ Shaking of Head) are used.
(Based on the Leading Ones Head-Based Gestures Recognition with GoogleVR Cardboard Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3icqAJnZF8Y).

Also has a script that allows the mouse to act as a stand-in input for the recognition if no VR headset is available.

# Version Of Software Used
* Unity 2018.2.6f originally, updated to Unity 2018.2.21f1.
* MicroSoft Visual Studio 2017 C#.

# Hardware Used
Used with the Oculus Rift (No Oculus Touch Controller(s)/ Xbox Controller).
Attempt was made with the HTC Vive but did not seem to respond to Unity, more testing is required to know whether it was Unity or the Project itself.

# Purpose For Creation
Used in a 3rd Year University Dissertation Project on Head Gestures based in Virtual Reality and one of the ways such Gestures could be implemented into VR.
